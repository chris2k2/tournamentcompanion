# Contributing Guidelines

As this is a very small project we follow a very simple process

* If you want to do something, create an issue and assign it to you. Or steal an unassigned one
* Do your work in a branch, if you are done create a Pull Request. The pull request will be merged by chris or it will be explained why not. 

## Quality Guidelines
In order to have the project at a high quality at all time, here are some hints:

* At the server unit tests are required. We want a branch coverage higher than 80% in total and 95% for the crucial parts (right now: standings)
* At the client unit tests are optional but appreciated.
* Stick to common rules (same formatter, etc.)
* As this is a playground project, feel free to use another technology/framework even it is not a 100% match
