== System Scope and Context

The communication partners are:

|=======
|Tournament Planner| The results must be read from the Tournament Planner, since this tool is used for organizing the event. This is a read-only direction.
|Play Store| The app will be distributed via the Play Store. So it must comply to all constraints given. This is a provide-only direction.
|=======

The communication partners have been kept minimal in order to avoid complexity.
