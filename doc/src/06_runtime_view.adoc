== Runtime View
The client gets a request and dispatches it to the correct component. This component will ask the server for data. The server
dispatches it to the correct component by itself and the component will access the Tp file to extract the information needed.

There is a caching layer between the component and the server, which might make it unneccessary to go to the server and thus to the Tp File.
