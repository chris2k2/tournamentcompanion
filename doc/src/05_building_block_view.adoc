== Building Block View

This chapter describes how everything is built together. It does not describe where something is deployed.

The system is separated into two building blocks. The client (de.cweyermann.btc.client.spa) and the server (de.cweyermann.btc.server). The client
is written in Typescript and builds strongly on the Angular Framework. Whereas the server is build with Java and builds strongly on the VertX framework.

=== Client
The client is simple, as it is dumb. It only shows the results the backend server calculated.

The client has a main page, which links to all the subpages, which are in their own folders. This does nothing more, than linking to all the subcomponents and the
styling. For this Bootstrap is used. The default component is "welcome", which shows a nice welcome text. All components use a backend service, which is responsile
for communicating with the server. 

=== Server
The server implements all the logic and the access to the Database. A microservice-like approach is chosen. This means the components can run independetly from another. The only shared code is in the control, which has certain calucation logic, 
like Group Standings etc.

Each component consists of:
* Tp File Access: Access to the TP File. This file is the data backend of the Tournament Planner. Indeed it is an Access MDB file. Therefore the ucanaccess JDBC driver is used. 
* Control: These are stateless, calculation objects. They can be instantiated copied, cloned and will simply perform certain math jobs.
* REST Layer: This is the presentation layer it gives out entities, which are serialized via the VertX Json Controller. 

All this is wired together by Startup.java. As all is built to be independet, it could be easily distributed to several machines.
