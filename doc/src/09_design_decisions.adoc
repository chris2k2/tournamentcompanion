== Design Decisions
Here are some design decisions documented. This should help other contributers to understand why it is built like this:

* Native App vs. Hybrid App: The App starts very simple. It should only display some results. All the logic has been developed in the backend. Thus
the app must just issue some REST calls and print themn. Since, initialy more platforms should have been supported a hybrid app approach has been chosen.

* Angular vs. other frameworks: Angullar has been the number 1 javascript framework at that time. Furthermore the inital author has some experience with it
and wants to build on that.

* Nuliga approach: This is a domain thing. The Badminton Community Mittelfranken (where the project origins) switched to Nuliga. However this has been AFTER
this project started (but before documentation...). So this is not taken into account
