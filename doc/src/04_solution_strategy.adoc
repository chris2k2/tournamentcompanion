== Solution Strategy

The general idea is to have an server access the database of the Tournament Planner, while the frontend only talks to the backend.

In this way the only critical point is the database of the Tournament Planner. Otherwise the app is completely autarc. 

* TDD: The backend is developed using Testdriven Development. An high percentage of unit tests, especially for the calcuation is crucial
* Bulk Answers: The server only answers with full context. This allows the client to keep the amount of requests minimal.
* Caching: The Server tells the client to cache the answers for 10s. This prevents the massive F5 usage. The server uses HTTP Caching Headers for that.
* BCE-Pattern: To separate concerns as good as possible the BCE (Boundary-Control-Entity) Pattern is used at the server
* Dumb Frontend: Everything is done at the backend. This will keep complexity at the backend, where it is well tested and managable.
* Hybrid app: Since this is a quite simple use case an hybrid app approach has been chosen.
