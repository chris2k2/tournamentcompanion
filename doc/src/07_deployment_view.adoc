The components are:
* Branded Tournament Companion App: The client (de.cweyermann.btc.client.spa) must be build into an Android app. This can be done
via Apache Cordova. Welcome texts, name, icons must be adapted and the server name (see component DyDNS Program) must be filled in.

* 4G Router: Since the app should run without any wifi, the server needs to be available via the Internet

* DyDNS program: Since the app is published in the store before the tournament the IP of the laptop is not known yet. Therefore
a DyDNS program should be used. It provides a name, which can be configured in the Branded Tournament Companion App, instead of an IP.

* Tournament Planner: External program to organize the tournament

* Tournament Companion Server: the server which provides the results. Has a configuration file which must be adapted
